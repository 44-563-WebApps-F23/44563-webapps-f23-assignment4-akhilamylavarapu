    <p>
        <b>NORA:</b>
        &nbsp;Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not
        see it until this evening, when it is dressed. _[To the PORTER, taking
        out her purse.]_ How much?</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PORTER:</b>
        &nbsp;Sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NORA:</b>
        &nbsp;There is a shilling. No, keep the change. _[The PORTER thanks her, and
        goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
        off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
        and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and
        listens.]_ Yes, he is in. _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
        right.]_
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HELMER:</b>
        &nbsp;
        _[calls out from his room]_. Is that my little lark twittering out
        there?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NORA:</b>
        &nbsp;
        _[busy opening some of the parcels]_. Yes, it is!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HELMER:</b>
        &nbsp;Is it my little squirrel bustling about?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NORA:</b>
        &nbsp;Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HELMER: </b>
        &nbsp;When did my squirrel come home?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NORA:</b>
        &nbsp;Just now. _[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
        mouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HELMER:</b>
        Don't disturb me. _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
        the room, pen in hand.]_ Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
        little spendthrift been wasting money again?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NORA:</b>
        &nbsp;Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
        This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HELMER:</b>
        &nbsp;Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NORA:</b>
        &nbsp;Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a
        tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
        of money.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HELMER:</b>
        &nbsp;Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
        salary is due.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NORA:</b>
        Pooh! we can borrow until then.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HELMER:</b>
        Nora! _[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]_ The same
        little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
        and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year's Eve
        a slate fell on my head and killed me, andâ€”
