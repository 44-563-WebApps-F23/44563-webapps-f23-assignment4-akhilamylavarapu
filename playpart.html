            &nbsp;Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. _<p>[To the PORTER, taking
                out her purse.]</p>_ How much?</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h6><b>PORTER:</b></h6>
            &nbsp;Sixpence.

            <h6><b>NORA:</b></h6>
            &nbsp;There is a shilling. No, keep the change. _<p>[The PORTER thanks her, and
                goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
                off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
                and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and
                listens.]</p>_ Yes, he is in. _<p>[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
                    right.]</p>_

            _<p>[calls out from his room]</p>_. Is that my little lark twittering out  
            there?

            <h6><b>NORA:</b></h6>

            _<p>[busy opening some of the parcels]</p>_. Yes, it is!

            <h6><b>HELMER:</b></h6>
            &nbsp;Is it my little squirrel bustling about?

            &nbsp;Yes!
