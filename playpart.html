            Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. _<p>[To the PORTER, taking
                out her purse.]</p>_ How much?</br>
        </p>
    
        <h6>PORTER.</h6>
        <p>
            Sixpence.
        </p>
    
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>
            There is a shilling. No, keep the change. _<p>[The PORTER thanks her, and
            goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
            off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
            and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and
            listens.]</p>_ Yes, he is in. _<p>[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
                right.]</p>_

            _<p>[calls out from his room]</p>_. Is that my little lark twittering out  
            there?
        </p>
    
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>
            _<p>[busy opening some of the parcels]</p>_. Yes, it is! 
        </p>
    
        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
        <p>
            Is it my little squirrel bustling about?
        </p>
    
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>
            Yes!
